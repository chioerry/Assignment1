			<h3>Nostalgic</h3>
			<span>Experience the nostalgic way</span><!--Used for a Tagline of the heading-->
			<p> In media and advertising, nostalgia-evoking images, sounds, and references can be used strategically to create a sense of 		connectedness between consumers and products with the goal of convincing the public to consume, watch, or buy advertised 		products. Modern technology facilitates nostalgia-eliciting advertising through the subject, style, and design of an 			advertisement. The feeling of longing for the past is easily communicated through social media and advertising because these 	 media require the participation of multiple senses, are able to represent their ideas entirely, and therefore become more 			reminiscent of 	reality.

			<p>
				Formal receptions are parties that are designed to receive a large number of guests, often at prestigious venues such as Buckingham Palace, the White House or Government Houses of the British Empire and Commonwealth. The hosts and any guests of honor form a receiving line in order of precedence near the entrance. Each guest is announced to the host who greets each one in turn as he or she arrives.

			<p>
				Art is a diverse range of human activities in creating visual, auditory or performing artifacts (artworks), expressing the author's imaginative or technical skill, intended to be appreciated for their beauty or emotional power. In their most general form these activities include the production of works of art, the criticism of art, the study of the history of art, and the aesthetic dissemination of art.

			<h2>Purpose of Art</h2>

			<p>
				Art has had a great number of different functions throughout its history, making its purpose difficult to abstract or quantify to any single concept. This does not imply that the purpose of Art is "vague", but that it has had many unique, different reasons for being created. Some of these functions of Art are provided in the following outline. The different purposes of art may be grouped according to those that are non-motivated, and those that are motivated (Lévi-Strauss).
